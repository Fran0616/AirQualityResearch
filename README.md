# AirQualityResearch


The quality of the air we breathe has a long, and short term effect on our health. According to the National Geographic, short term effects on bad air quality towards humans 
include “discomfort such as pneumonia or bronchitis. They also include discomfort such as irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin”. Long term effects include heart
disease, lung cancer, and respiratory disease such as emphysema… also cause long-term damage to people’s nerve, brain, kidneys, live, and other organs” and according to the
National Geography article ‘nearly 2.5 millon people die worldwide each year from the effects of outdoors or indoor pollution”.  Effect of air pollution varies from children to
adults. Children and the elederly are more at risk of developing health conditions. The air quality also affects the environment; they can contaminate the surface of bodies of
water and soil, kill crops, kill young trees and other plants. “Hazy air pollution can even muffle sounds”. The bigger effect of air quality is the warming of the planner.
‘Global warming is an environmental phenomenon caused by natural and anthropogenic air pollution. It refers to rising air and ocean temperatures around the world’. Carbon
dioxide from our burning of fossil fuels gets trapped in the atmosphere and warms up the average temperature of the earth. There are also natural greenhouse gasses from things
such as volcanoes. Less developing nations and large cities tend to have more air pollution. The article states that some of the worlds most populated cities are Karachi,
Pakistan, New Delhi, India; Beiking, China; Lima, Puru; and Cairo, Egypt… many developing nations also have air pollution problems. Los Angeles, California, is nicknamed Smog
City” [1].

For my research topic I wanted to focus on air quality in the United States and observe how they differ based on population and other factors such as wind. My motivation for doing this is because I am a living organism living on this planet and would like to be part of the change to curb global warming. I want to start locally so I chose to only focus on the United States for this research, but also include the European Air Quality Index alongside the Chinese Index for any discrepancies. I divided the United States into three regions eastern cities, southeast cities, and west coast cities. I chose to do that because I also wanted to see if there is any correlation by region. I also understand that different regions have different weather patterns, so I want to see if those differences will have an effect on the air quality.
